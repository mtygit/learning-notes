# Express REST API

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
    - printing a message
    - trigger an error handler
    - request timestamp

2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?

    - false, a middleware function requires `next` argument to proceed to next

3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

    - `response.end()`
    - `response.status(number).send('message')`


4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

    - after HTTP method and before the Path

5. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

    - callback has been called twice
    - another function trying to set a header or status code

## Terms 

- Middleware: functions that that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server

- Request Object: the main entry point for an application to issue a request to the Library

- Response Object: send data from the server to the client through an HTTP request

- Application Middleware: send requests to the server

- Routing Middleware: bound to an instance of `express.Router()`
