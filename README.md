# Reading Notes

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Tianyi (Tim) Ma. Welcome to my page about learning how to code. I am currently taking courses with Code Fellows and here are my notes to share with you.

## Growth Mindset

A growth mindset to me means that never stop to improve yourself. You have the abilities to develop by putting in effort and passion, and never stop where you at.

### To stay in a growth mindset by doing the following:

- Stay Positive

- Look things up
