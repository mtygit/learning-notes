<brq  />We need `<img>` to add an image, along with *src* to indicate where to find the image, *alt* to provide a text dexcription if the image counld not show up, and *title* to provide additional information about the image.

<br />There are things need to be taking cared of:

- how to aligne images
- the right format of image
- the right size of image
- the correct resolution
- transparency

- making sure there is enough contrast between text and background color
- opacity will allow specify the opacity of an element and its child elements
