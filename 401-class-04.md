# Data Modeling

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  
  - easy to debug
  - reducing the defect rates
  - increasing the technical quality


- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

  - `beforeEach()` run before each test 
  - `afterEach()` run after each test

- What is one downside of Test Driven Development

  - the tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand

- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

  - ES6 Classes has a cleaner and easier syntax compares to Constructor/Prototype Classes

- Why REST?

  - REST is easy to use and modify, it's more flexible and scalable.

## Terminology

**functional programming**	creating software with pure functions that avoid shared state

**object-oriented programming (OOP)**  creates software design around data/objects

**class**  a template for creating objects

`super` the parent level class 

`this` a pointer to an object in order to use it's properties 

**Test Driven Development (TDD)**  process of coding and testing

**Jest**  a JavaScript testing framework allows you to write tests


**Continuous Integration (CI)**  the process of integrating code into a shared repository 


**REST**  Representational State Transfer
