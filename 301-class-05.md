# React Docs - thinking in React

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
  - drawing boxes around components to help visulizing the heirarchy

2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
  - keep each component simple and doing one thing only

3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
  - there will be no interactions, everything is fixed and not responsive 

4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
  - adding interactions and states

5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
  - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

6. How can you identify where state needs to live?
  - Identify every component 
  - Find a common owner component 
  - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state
  - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
