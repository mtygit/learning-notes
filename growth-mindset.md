## Growth Mindset:

### Explain “growth mindset” in your own words:
A growth mindset to me means that never stop to improve yourself. You have the abilities to develop by putting in effort and passion, and never stop where you at.

### Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
  1. Do not avoid any challenges and obstacles
  2. Giving my best effort into it
  3. Being open to the opposite opinions and learn from it
