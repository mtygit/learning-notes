## The ABC of Programming

A: The definition of the script and the way to create one

- The computers can do and only do what you instructed it to do, so write the instructions programmatically 
- When writing a script, break down your goal into a list of simple tasks and then figure out the steps to complete that task

B: The ways for computers to fit in the real world

- Creating the models of the world through data
- Using objects to represent physical things
- Setting properties to the object
- Using methods to perform tasks
- Creating events when a user interacts with the computer
- HTML markup is used to create a model of the web page
- Using code to make web pages interactive
