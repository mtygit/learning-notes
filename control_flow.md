## Expression, Operator, and Function

An expression evaluates into a single value:
1. The expression that assigns a value to a variable
2. The expression that uses 2 or more values to return a single value

The operator creates a single value from one or more values. Types of operators:
- Arithmetic operators:
  - \+:         addition
  - \-:          subtraction
  - \*:          multiplication 
  - \*\*:        exponentiation
  - /:           division
  - %:           modulus
  - \+\+:        increment
  - \-\-:        decrement
- Assignment Operators:
  - =
  - +=
  - -=
  - *=
  - /=
  - %=
  - **=
- String operators:
  - \+:          
    - Adding two numbers will return the sum
    - Adding a number and a string will return a string
- Comparison operators:
  - ==:          equal to
  - ===:         equal value and equal type
  - !=:          not equal
  - !==:         not equal value or not equal type
  - \>:          greater than
  - \<:          less than
  - \>=:         greater than or equal to
  - \<=:         less than or equal to
  - ?:           ternary operator
- Logical operators:
  - &&:          logical and
  - ||:          logical or
  - !:           logical not
- Type operators:
  - typeof:      returns the type of a variable
  - instanceof:  returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Tips of using a function:
- Declare a function using the *function* keyword
- Give the function a name followed by parentheses
- The statements that perform the task sit in a code block
- Functions can be used as variable values
- Variables declared within a function become **LOCAL** to the function
