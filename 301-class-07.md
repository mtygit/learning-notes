# REST


## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

  - co-creator of HTTP specification, REST protocol, and Apache HTTP Server Project

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

  - because they weren't designed for that

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

  - it is like applying verbs to nouns, so the browser can do things

4. What does a GET do?

  - it's geting stuff

5. What does a POST do?

  - adding stuff to a location

6. What does PUT do?

  - deleting or removing things from a location

7. What does PATCH do?

  - partial update to other system
