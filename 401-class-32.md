# Context API--Behaviors

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

  - I think functional component would be better in this case

- What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

  - Auth
  - Theme


- How can you best test context?

  - Checking it in a child component to see if you have the access to it


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- context: it provides a global state that can be accessed by all its children components without using props

- useContext(): its a hook in React and returns the current context value

- static context: static class field to initialize your contextType
