## Function, Methods, and Objects

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Tips of using a function:
- Declare a function using the *function* keyword
- Give the function a name followed by parentheses
- The statements that perform the task sit in a code block
- Functions can be used as variable values
- Variables declared within a function become **LOCAL** to the function
