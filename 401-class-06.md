# Authentication

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

  - It is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance

2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

  - A singleton represents a single instance of an object. Only one can be created, no matter how many times the object is instantiated. If there’s already an instance, the singleton will create a new one.


3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

  - use Singleton to prevent other objects from instantiating their own copies of the Singleton object, ensuring that all objects access the single instance

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Router Middleware: a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response

- Dynamic Module Loading: a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory


- Singleton Pattern: it restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance


- CRUD -> REST Method Matches

  - create--POST
  - read--GET
  - update--PUT
  - delete--DELETE

- Mock Testing

  - creating a fake version of an external or internal service that can stand in for the real one, helping your tests run more quickly and more reliably
