# Context API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
  
  - `useState()`is setting the initial state and returning the actual state and a function to update the state
  - `useReducer()`accepts a reducer function and an initial state, and it returns the actual state and a dispatch function. The dispatch function alters state in an implicit way by mapping actions to state transitions

- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

  - This convention is very important. Without it, React wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because React couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.

- What do custom hooks usually do?

  - the custom hooks will keep functional components simple and clean

- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

  - react-fetch-hook:it will get the data and the isLoading state

- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

  - by using useEffect() hook, we can get the API data when the component that contains API call function was updated


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- reducer: a function that determines changes to an application's state
