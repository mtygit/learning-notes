# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

- Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

  - In React, all the components are connected to the base index.html file. Instead of creating a brand new page, React only renders the components that is being updated. The multi-page app is actually being rendered in a single page.

- If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

  - Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`

- What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

  - the components in unmounted

- What does props.children contain?

  - it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component

- How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

  - useState() is a hook function in React used in a function component to use the state functionality and this.setState() is used in class component to reset the state value in that component

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook: special function that lets you “hook into” React features

- Mounting and Un-Mounting: React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.
