# Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

  - Global state can get very large and complicated and the Context API is not effective handling this.

- What is the purpose of a reducer?

  - The reducer is used to prevent states are being mutated.

- What does an action contain?

  - An action contains type and payload. The type will tell the reducer what kind action it needs to perform, and the payload will pass the parameter to the reducer.

- Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

  - This will prevent the state is being mutated.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- immutable state: its value cannot be changed once it's created
- time travel in redux: the process of logging actions and state during an app's execution
- action creator: a function that literally creates an action object
- reducer: functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result
- dispatch: a function of the Redux store that will trigger a state change
