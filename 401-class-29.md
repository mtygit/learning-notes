# Advanced State with Reducers


## Review, Research, and Discussion

- How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

  - adding an empty `[]` after the callback function in useEffect()

- Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

  - no, useState() should update one state variable at a time

- Is useState() synchronous?

  - no, it is asynchronous. It does not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- State Hook: special function that lets you “hook into” React features


- Component Lifecycle: there are four parts of a component's lifecycle, initialization, mounting, updating, and unmounting
