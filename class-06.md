## Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### Objects

An object is a grouped variables and functions that are used to create a model to represent something in the real world. An object has property and method. We can access an object using dot notation.

### Document Object Model

The Document Object Model defines how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

- the browser represents the page using a DOM tree
- DOM trees have four types of nodes
  1. document nodes
  2. element nodes
  3. attribute nodes
  4. text nodes
- using id, class attributes, tag name, or CSS selector syntax to select element nodes
- if a DOM query returns more than one node, it will return a NodeList
- an element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements
- browser offers tools for viewing the DOM tree
