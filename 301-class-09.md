# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

  - a programming paradigm treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  - it returns the same result by given the same arguments
  - it doesn't cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

  - only accessing parameters passed to the function that returns the same result based on the parameters

4. What is immutability?

  - unchanging over time or unable to be changed

5. What is Referential transparency?

- a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

  - use `require(path to the module)`

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

  - `module.exports = module;`
