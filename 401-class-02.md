1. What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

    - 200s: success
    - 400 Bad Request: a generic unsuccessful request
    - 401 Unauthorized: the client is not authenticated
    - 403 Forbidden: don't have the permission

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and REST

    - SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style
