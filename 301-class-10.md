## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?

  - it is a function invocation

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

  - one 

3. What does LIFO mean?

  - last in, first out

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

 `function firstFunction(){`
  `console.log("Hello from firstFunction");`
`}`

`function secondFunction(){`
  `firstFunction();`
  `console.log("The end from secondFunction");`
`}`

`secondFunction();`

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?

  - when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point

## JavaScript error messages


1. What is a ‘reference error’?

  - try to use a variable that is not yet declared

2. What is a ‘syntax error’?

  - occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

3. What is a ‘range error’?

  - try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length

4. What is a ‘tyep error’?

  - when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible

5. What is a breakpoint?

  - a point that allows you to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines

6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

  - it allows you to see the history before reaching that breakpoint
